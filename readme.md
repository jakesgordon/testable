# Programming Language Test Harnesses

This repository contains skeleton projects for common programming languages that enable
me to quickly write some code with unit testing setup and ready to go.

## Elixir

Using Elixir's built in [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/1.12/ExUnit.html) test framework:

```
> mix test
```

## Ruby

Using Ruby's [minitest](https://github.com/minitest/minitest) framework:

```
> bundle install
> rake test
```

## Javascript

Using [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) as the test framework:

```
> npm install
> npm test
```

## Go

Using Go's built in [testing](https://pkg.go.dev/testing#hdr-Subtests_and_Sub_benchmarks) package:

```
> go install
> go test
```
