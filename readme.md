# Programming Language Test Harnesses

This repository contains skeleton projects for common programming languages that enable
me to quickly write some code with unit testing setup and ready to go.

## Elixir

Using Elixir's built in [ExUnit](https://hexdocs.pm/ex_unit/1.12/ExUnit.html) test framework:

```
> mix test
```

## Javascript

Using [Ava](https://github.com/avajs/ava) as the test framework:

```
> npm install
> npm test
```
